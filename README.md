# EasyAuction

EasyAuction should become a platform to execute batch auctions for fair initial offerings and token buyback programs. Batch auctions are a market mechanism for matching limit orders of buyers and sellers of a particular good with one fair clearing price.
Already in traditional finance, batch auctions have established themselves as a tool for initial offerings, and in the blockchain ecosystem, they are expected to become a fundamental DeFi building lego brick for price-discovery as well.
The EasyAuction platform is inspired by the auction mechanism of the Gnosis Protocol v1, which has shown a significant product-market fit for initial dex offerings (IDOs) (cp. sales of DIA, mStable, etcâ€¦). EasyAuction improves significantly the user experience for IDOs, by settling up arbitrary many bids with a single clearing price instead of roughly 28 orders and thereby making the mechanism fairer, easier to use, and more predictable.
Given the emerging regulations for IDOs and utility sales - see MiCA -, EasyAuction is intending to comply with them and enabling new projects a safe start without legal risks.

## Use cases

### Initial token offering with a fair price-discovery

This batch auction mechanism allows communities, projects, and DAOs to offer their future stakeholders fair participation within their ecosystem by acquiring utility and governance tokens. One of the promises of DeFi is the democratization and communitization of big corporate infrastructures to build open platforms for the public good. By running a batch auction, these projects facilitate one of the fairest distribution of stakes. Projects should demonstrate their interest in fair participation by setting a precedence for future processes by choosing this fair auction principle over private multi-stage sales.
Auction based initial offerings are also picking up in the traditional finance world. Google was one of the first big tech companies using a similar auction mechanism with a unique clearing price to IPO. Nowadays, companies like Slack and Spotify are advocating similar approaches as well via Direct Listings: Selling their stocks in the pre-open auction on the first day of trading.
Overall this market for initial token offerings is expected to grow significantly over time together with the ecosystem. Even on gnosis protocol version 1, a platform not intended for this use case, was able to facilitate IDOs with a total of more than 20 million funding.
